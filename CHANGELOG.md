## [v0.2-alpha]
### Changes
- App Icon
- Fancy toggle button
- Bug fixes
- New Grabber (old grabber can be enabled in the settings)

### Known Bugs
- OpenGL grabber will sometimes hang when started, making the lights unresponsive. Quitting the app and starting again generally fixes the problem.
- New grabber fails to send any data the first time it is initialized. Turning off and back on one more time seems to fix the problem.
